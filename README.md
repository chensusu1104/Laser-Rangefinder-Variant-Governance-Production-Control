# Multi-Variant Platform Governance for Hunting Laser Rangefinder  
(US Market | 2020 | Mass Production Program)

## Program Context

A hunting laser rangefinder product line was developed for a U.S. outdoor brand, consisting of three yardage variants:

- 650-yard
- 850-yard
- 1300-yard

Annual production scale: ~30,000 units  
Development-to-ramp cycle: ~6 months  

All variants were built under a unified mechanical architecture.

## Platform Architecture Strategy

The program was structured around a shared mechanical platform.

Common elements:
- External housing design
- Structural assembly architecture
- Mechanical interfaces

Variant-specific elements were constrained to:
- Internal optical configuration
- PCB configuration
- Calibration parameters

This platform strategy reduced tooling complexity while increasing configuration governance requirements.

---

## Variant Governance Model

Platform governance required:

- Clear separation between shared and variant-specific BOM layers
- Configuration discipline to prevent cross-model contamination
- Production-line integrity controls for model differentiation
- Structured validation before ramp authorization

The complexity of this program was not invention, but controlled variation at scale.

---

## Structural & Reliability Control

Manufacturing stability was governed through:

- IPX4 waterproof sealing integrity
- Plastic + silicone overmolding consistency
- Assembly fit repeatability
- Drop-test durability validation
- Surface durability verification

Ramp progression was conditional upon repeatable structural stability.

---

## Production Ramp Discipline

Mass production was treated as an authorization gate, not a schedule milestone.

Ramp release required:

- Variant integrity validation
- Mechanical stability confirmation
- Configuration control verification
- Defect containment readiness

---

## Cost & Platform Economics

- Unit-level cost breakdown maintained across all variants
- Platform reuse balanced against variant differentiation
- Structural consistency preserved under cost discipline

---

## Demonstrated Capabilities

- Multi-variant hardware platform governance
- Structural boundary definition under shared architecture
- Configuration control at production scale
- Waterproof and overmolding stability governance
- Ramp authorization discipline
